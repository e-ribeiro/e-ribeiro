### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Eder Ribeiro](https://twitter.com/oribeiroeder), and I am a software developer at [@acessodigi](https://twitter.com/acessodigi) based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil.

As a software developer, my focus was always with backend and the languages that I use on my work days are:

- Golang, the main language at these days;
- PHP, the first that I worked;
- Javascript, it's a kind of personal interest;
